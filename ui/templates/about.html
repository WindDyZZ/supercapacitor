        We are a team of enthusiastic undergraduates from SIIT. This project is an integral part of our senior project for the first semester of the year 2023. Our goal is to provide a valuable tool that aids in saving time and reducing costs associated with experiments aimed at determining the capacitance of a supercapacitor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our project involved meticulous data gathering and robust machine learning techniques. While we have taken great care in developing this tool, it's essential to consider possible margin of errors in predictions.
